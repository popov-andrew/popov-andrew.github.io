## Portfolio Website
To modify or create your own version:

First, run the development server, I use NPM:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Eventually, I will add more stuff and change the font

## How did I deploy?
The page is built on push through a github workflow (nextjs.yml)
